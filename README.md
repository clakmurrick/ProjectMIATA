# ProjectMIATA

My Miata project that includes customizing an 1990 NA Miata!

Currently this project uses WinBGI, so it is near impossible to run. Have fun.

FEATURES:
- All 16 WinBGI colors and individual body panels.
- Option to make the Miata slammed.
- Individual panel selections allow for easy color changes.
- Keyboard controls to use the left and right arrows.

TODO
- [ ] Sound effects.
- [ ] Option to raise the Miata.
- [ ] Looking to add more wheel choices.
